### Identification of sequence blocks

The following pipeline was used to identify B and sex chromosomes sequences on the genome of the species *Holochilus sciureus* (2n = 56, NF = 56), a Neotropical rodent of Oryzomyini tribe. This same pipeline was already used to identify sequence blocks of B chromosome on the cichlid fish *Astatotilapia latifasciata* ([Valente et al. 2014](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24770715/)), and on the *Astyanax* fish ([Ahmad et al. 2020](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07072-1)).
